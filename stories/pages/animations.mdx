# Animations

Animations can enhance user experience by providing visual feedback and guiding user attention. However, it's important to use them judiciously to avoid overwhelming users or causing distractions.

## Theme Assets
The Notre Dame Design System provides a set of predefined CSS classes and guidelines for implementing animations in a consistent manner across applications.

### Animation CSS
**Link:** [https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/animate.css](https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/animate.css)\
**Usage:** Include in head of document after main stylesheet.

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/animate.css">
``` 
### Accessibility
In order to reduce motion for users who have indicated a preference for reduced motion in their system settings, animations must be wrapped in a media query as shown below:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {}
```

## How It Works
The animation system works by using the `.animate` class plus a `.animation--*` modifier class to apply different types of animations to elements.

### Available Animation Classes
| CSS Class                                 | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.animate`                                | Base class to enable animations on an element.                |
| `.animate--fade-in`                       | Fades the element in from 0% to 100% opacity.                 |
| `.animate--fade-in-up`                    | Fades the element in while moving it up slightly.             |
| `.animate--fade-in-down`                  | Fades the element in while moving it down slightly.           |
| `.animate--fade-in-left`                  | Fades the element in while moving it left slightly.           |
| `.animate--fade-in-right`                 | Fades the element in while moving it right slightly.          |
| `.animate--move-up`                       | Moves the element up slightly without changing opacity.       |
| `.animate--move-down`                     | Moves the element down slightly without changing opacity.     |
| `.animate--move-left`                     | Moves the element left slightly without changing opacity.     |
| `.animate--move-right`                    | Moves the element right slightly without changing opacity.    |

## Best Practices
<ul className="list--todo">
  <li>
    ### Dos
    <ul>
      <li>Use animations to indicate state changes, such as loading indicators or button presses.</li>
      <li>Keep animations short and purposeful, typically under 500 milliseconds.</li>
      <li>Ensure animations are smooth and do not hinder usability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Don'ts
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid excessive or unnecessary animations that can distract users.</li>
      <li>Do not use animations that may trigger motion sensitivity in users.</li>
      <li>Avoid long or complex animations that delay user interactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
