    # Responsive Breakpoints

    The ND Web Theme has been developed to be mobile first, using media queries to create a few breakpoints for our layouts. Here are the primary breakpoints we use:
  </div>
  <div className="sb-section">
    ```css
      /* Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 480px) */
      /* No media query. This is default. */

      /* Small devices (landscape phones, 480px and up) */
      @media only screen and (min-width:30em) {

      /* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
      @media only screen and (min-width:48em) { ... }

      /* Large devices (desktops, 960px and up) */
      @media only screen and (min-width:60em) { ... }

    /* Large devices (tablets horizontal, 1280px and up) */
      @media only screen and (min-width:80em) { ... }

      /* Extra large devices (large desktops, 1600px and up) */
      @media only screen and (min-width:100em) { ... }
    ```
  </div>
