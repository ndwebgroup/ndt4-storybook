## Governance and Policies

NDT4 is maintained by the [ND Web Team](https://creative.nd.edu/web/), which manages the roadmap, reviews proposals, and approves changes. Use the official theme assets. Do not recreate the theme or fork core styles outside approved processes. Campus units may partner with the ND Web Team or an external agency. If working with an outside vendor, consult the Web Team at project start to confirm brand, performance, hosting, and accessibility compliance. The ND Web Team may provide corrections or recommendations to sites that do not adhere to University standards. Contact webhelp@nd.edu with questions. Releases follow semantic versioning and are recorded in the [changelog](/docs/changelog-ndt4-changelog--docs) so teams can plan upgrades.

## Accessibility

NDT4 supports inclusive design by default. Color tokens meet contrast targets. Focus styles and keyboard navigation are built in. Component docs include ARIA guidance and labeling patterns.
