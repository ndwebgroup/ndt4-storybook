# CSS Cascade Layers

NDT4 uses **CSS Cascade Layers** to organize and control the order in which styles are applied. Cascade layers provide a structured way to manage specificity and override rules in large or complex projects.

## Overview of Cascade Layers

Cascade layers allow you to group CSS rules into named layers, which are then applied in a specific order. This helps prevent unintended overrides and makes it easier to maintain your styles.

Learn more about the concept on the [MDN Cascade Layers Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers).

## Layer Syntax

For information regarding the syntax of CSS layers, see the [MDN @layer documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer).

The predefined layers in NDT4 are:

```css
@layer base, theme, utilities, print, site;
```

NDT4 does not include any styles in the `site` layer. This layer is reserved for custom styles that are specific to your site. You can add your own styles to this layer by using the `@layer` rule in your CSS files.
