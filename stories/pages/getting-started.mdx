# Getting Started

## Theme Assets

In order to maintain consistency across all sites, the Web Theme makes use of common asset files. These shared assets provide a common foundation on which to build.

### CSS and JavaScript

#### Global CSS
**Link:** [https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.css](https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.css)\
**Usage:** Include in head of document before any other stylesheets.

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/3.0/ndt.css">
```

#### Global JavaScript
**Link:** [https://conductor.nd.edu/javascripts/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.js](https://conductor.nd.edu/javascripts/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.js)\
**Usage:** Place toward end of the document, right before the closing body tag.

```html
  <script src="https://conductor.nd.edu/javascripts/themes/ndt/3.0/ndt.js"></script>
```

#### Site JavaScript
**Source:** [https://github.com/ndwebgroup/ndt3-html/blob/master/javascripts/site.js](https://github.com/ndwebgroup/ndt3-html/blob/master/javascripts/site.js)\
**Usage:** Unlike the Global JavaScript file, this file is meant to be copied and modified for each specific site. It includes code responsible for **loading the NDT Icon set**, but can be extended or modified as needed.

```html
  <script src="/path/to/site.js"></script>
```

### Icon Set
**Link:** [https://static.nd.edu/images/icons/base-v1.svg](https://static.nd.edu/images/icons/base-v1.svg)
Usage Must be inlined within the document to be accessible. This is done by default by the Web Themeâ€™s site.js.
