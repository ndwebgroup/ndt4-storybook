## Theme Assets

In order to maintain consistency across all sites, the Web Theme makes use of common asset files. These shared assets provide a common foundation on which to build.

### CSS and JavaScript

#### Global CSS
**Link:** [https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.css](https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.css)\
**Usage:** Include in head of document before any other stylesheets.

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://conductor.nd.edu/stylesheets/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.css">
```

#### Global JavaScript
**Link:** [https://conductor.nd.edu/javascripts/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.js](https://conductor.nd.edu/javascripts/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.js)\
**Usage:** Place toward end of the document, right before the closing body tag.

```html
  <script src="https://conductor.nd.edu/javascripts/themes/ndt/4.0/ndt.js"></script>
```
