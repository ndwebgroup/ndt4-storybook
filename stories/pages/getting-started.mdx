# Getting Started

The Notre Dame Web Theme is a design kit for web designers. As such, the University has provided everything a web professional needs to build a new website using the Notre Dame Web Theme. Please do not attempt to recreate the Web Theme, but take advantage of the assets available here.
To develop a new website using the Web Theme, campus units may partner with the [ND Web Team](https://creative.nd.edu), the preferred vendor for campus units, or contract with an external agency. Units looking to contract with outside vendors must [consult with the Web Team](mailto:webhelp@nd.edu) first, at the onset of the project, to ensure compliance with performance, hosting, and accessibility standards. As such, the ND Web Team reserves the right to provide corrections or recommendations to any campus websites that do not closely adhere to [University standards](https://onmessage.nd.edu/university-branding/website-requirements/).
