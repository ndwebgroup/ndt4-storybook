# Getting Started

**TODO: Review content before public release**

NDT4 is the Notre Dame Web Theme design kit for web designers and developers. The University provides everything a web professional needs to build a new website using the [Notr Dame Web Theme](https://webtheme.nd.edu). Please do not recreate the theme. Use the assets and guidance available here to ensure consistency, performance, and accessibility.
If you are developing a new website, campus units may partner with the [ND Web Team](https://creative.nd.edu), the preferred vendor for campus projects, or work with an external agency. Units that plan to use outside vendors must consult the Web Team at the start of the project to confirm compliance with performance, hosting, and accessibility standards. The ND Web Team reserves the right to provide corrections or recommendations to any campus websites that do not closely follow University standards.

## Using Storybook

We use Storybook to provide coded components, visual examples, and documentation. Each component includes:

- Docs with usage guidance, accessibility notes, and code snippets
- Interactive stories with controls to configure variants, sizes, and states

### What is a story

A story is an interactive preview of a component. Use the controls to change options. The preview and HTML update so you can copy exactly what you need.

### Storybook organization

- **[Getting Started:](/docs/getting-started--docs)** how to understand NDT4 and add it to your project
