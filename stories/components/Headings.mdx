Headings create clear hierarchical structure for page content. They help with both readability and accessibility.

## Heading Classes

You can also use the corresponding class (e.g., \`.h3\`) to make any element look like a heading.
This is useful when the HTML structure requires a different heading level for semantic reasons,
but visually you want it to match a different heading style.

**Note:** Using heading classes doesn't change the semantic meaning of an element.
For accessibility reasons, use actual heading elements (h1-h6) for page structure when possible.

## Usage

HTML headings `<h2>` through `<h6>` are available for use in content (`<h1>` is reserved for the title of the page). Remember to use headings sequentially without skipping a level. An `<h2>` is always followed by an `<h2>` or `<h3>`, and an `<h3>` is followed by an `<h3>` or `<h4>`, etc. For most content, `<h4>`-`<h6>`s aren't necessary, but they are included for rare instances.

<ul className="list--todo">
  <li>
    ### Dos
    <ul>
      <li>Headings must be white or brand blue, depending on background.</li>
      <li>Heading fonts may be used only for headlines and titles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Donts
    <ul>
      <li>Headings can not be used in all caps unless the heading is an acronym.</li>
      <li>Avoid linked headings when possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Accessibility

Headings must be used in sequential order (i.e., do not skip heading levels) to ensure proper document structure for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
