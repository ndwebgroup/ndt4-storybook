## Usage

Accordion components can be used to hide and show related content, such as FAQs, Program listings, or additional information. They help to keep the page clean and organized by allowing users to expand and collapse sections as needed.

<ul className="list--todo">
  <li>
    ### Dos
    <ul>
      <li>Accordions should be used to hide non-critical information that users may want to access on demand.</li>
      <li>Use clear and concise titles for each accordion panel to help users understand the content</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Donts
    <ul>
      <li>Don't use accordions for content that is already well-organized or easy to scan.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Accessibility

- Match each accordion heading `<summary>` to the surrounding page structure. For example, if the accordion sits within a section that has an `<h2>` heading, use `<h3>` for each panel title in your markup.
- Large accordions create long tab stops and slow navigation for keyboard users. Group related content, or split content across sections, to reduce the total number of panels.
