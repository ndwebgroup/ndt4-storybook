## Accessibility

- Match each accordion header to the surrounding page structure. For example, if the accordion sits within a section headed by h2, use h3 for each panel title in your markup.
- Large accordions create long tab stops and slow navigation for keyboard users. Group related content, or split content across sections, to reduce the total number of panels.
