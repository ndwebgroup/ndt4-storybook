## Usage

The Card component can be used to showcase important calls to action. They help to organize information and make it easily scannable for users.

<ul className="list--todo">
  <li>
    ### Dos
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure there is sufficient padding and margin around cards to prevent clutter.</li>
      <li>Use high-quality images that are relevant to the content of the card.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Donts
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid overcrowding cards with too much information.</li>
      <li>Since a card acts as a single unit, each one should have no more than one `.card-link` associated with it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Accessibility
